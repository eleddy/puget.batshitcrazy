Introduction

This package adds JSON api support to dexterity. It requires a branch of 
dexterity at the moment with good api support that is currently not 
tested but will be (I promise!).  Get that at https://github.com/eleddy/plone.dexterity
for now. Hopefully SOMEONE gets off their fat ass and writes test 
cases so it can actually be merged.

To use, just add /json to the end of any dexterity content type url.

THATS IT.
